This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Notes to self

**m3-router** exercise involves:

## The task:
Edit the /src/App.js file to create a router (like the example one between lines 12 and 20), with this behaviour:
* when you visit http://localhost:3000/ you will see the __"Home"__ component
* when you visit http://localhost:3000/child you will see the __"Child"__ component
* when you visit http://localhost:3000/blah you will see the __"Error"__ component
* and the __"Navigation"__ component is visible in all 3 scenarios

## Stretch Tasks:

1. Create **Dynamic Routes** e.g. http://localhost:3000/child/:childId

2. **Pass prop/state via render props** into react router component (likely handled by Dynamic Routes)

3. **Programatic navigation with history**: handle history via render route props by putting a 'Back Home' button in the Child component

4. Handle any **Dynamic Route URL errors**
